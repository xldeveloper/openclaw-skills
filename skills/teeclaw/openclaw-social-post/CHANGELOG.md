# Changelog

All notable changes to the social-post skill will be documented in this file.

## [1.5.0] - 2026-02-11

### Added
- **Dynamic Twitter tier detection**: Auto-detects Basic vs Premium/Premium+ accounts
  - Automatically adjusts character limits based on account subscription tier
  - Basic/Free accounts: 280 chars (252 with buffer)
  - Premium/Premium+ accounts: 25,000 chars (22,500 with buffer)
  - Smart caching: Tier cached for 24 hours to minimize API calls
  - Graceful fallback: Defaults to Basic tier if detection fails
- **Interactive threading choice for Premium accounts**:
  - When Premium user posts > 280 but < 25k chars, shows draft as single long post first
  - Prompts: "Thread this instead? (y/n)"
  - User can choose between single long post or threaded format
  - Respects `--thread` flag to force threading (skip prompt)
  - Respects `--auto-confirm` flag to skip all prompts
- **New tier detection library**: `lib/tier-detection.sh`
  - `detect_twitter_tier()`: Detects Basic/Premium/Premium+ tier via Twitter API
  - `get_twitter_char_limit()`: Returns raw character limit for account
  - `get_twitter_char_limit_buffered()`: Returns limit with 10% safety buffer
  - `cache_tier()`: Stores tier detection result with timestamp
  - `get_cached_tier()`: Retrieves cached tier if < 24h old
- **New flags**:
  - `--refresh-tier`: Force refresh account tier cache (useful after upgrading subscription)
  - Updated `--thread`: Now explicitly forces thread mode (was implicit before)
  - Updated `--auto-confirm`: Now skips ALL prompts including threading choice
- **Tier cache file**: `~/.openclaw/workspace/memory/twitter-account-tiers.json`
  - Stores tier detection results per account
  - JSON format: `{"account": {"tier": "premium", "checkedAt": 1234567890}}`
  - Auto-expires after 24 hours

### Changed
- **Dynamic character limits**: Twitter limits now adjust per account tier automatically
- **Updated validation**: `lib/validate.sh` now uses dynamic limits from tier detection
- **Updated threading logic**: `lib/threads.sh` respects Premium account 25k limit
- **Improved draft preview**: Shows detected account tier and available character limit
- **Enhanced help text**: Documents tier detection, Premium features, and new flags

### Technical
- Twitter API v2 used for tier detection
- Tier detection uses `/users/me` endpoint with `user.fields=subscription_type`
- Fallback detection via test post attempt (checks error message for char limit)
- Cache invalidation after 24 hours or with `--refresh-tier` flag
- Multi-account aware: Each account can have different tier
- Zero breaking changes: Existing workflows continue to work

### Use Cases
- Premium users can post long-form threads without artificial character limits
- Basic users get accurate 280-char validation
- Automatic adaptation when upgrading from Basic to Premium
- Single skill supports both Basic and Premium posting workflows

## [1.4.0] - 2026-02-10

### Added
- **Auto-variation feature**: New `--vary` flag to avoid Twitter's duplicate content detection
  - Automatically introduces subtle, natural differences to text
  - Prevents "duplicate content" errors when posting similar text from multiple accounts
  - Variations include: emoji additions, punctuation changes, spacing adjustments, synonym swaps
  - Shows both original and varied text in draft preview
  - Guarantees visible variation (will always change something)
  - Works seamlessly with all existing features (images, threads, multi-account)
- **New variation library**: `lib/variation.sh` with intelligent text transformation functions
  - `vary_text()`: Applies 2-3 random variations
  - `vary_punctuation()`: Changes sentence-ending punctuation
  - `vary_emoji()`: Adds/removes emojis
  - `vary_spacing()`: Adjusts line breaks
  - `vary_wording()`: Subtle synonym swaps

### Features
- Bypass Twitter's anti-spam duplicate content blocker
- Natural, human-like text variations
- Preview variations before posting

### Use Case
Solves the problem of posting the same announcement from multiple Twitter accounts (e.g., company + personal accounts) without triggering Twitter's duplicate content detection.

### Technical
- Uses bash `shuf` for randomization
