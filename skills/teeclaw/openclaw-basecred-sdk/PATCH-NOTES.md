# Security Patch Notes

**Date:** 2026-02-11  
**Patch Version:** 1.0.1 → 1.0.2 (security hardening + portability fix)

## Changes Applied

### 1. ✅ Created Proper Manifest (`skill.json`)

**Issue:** No skill.json manifest existed; credentials not declared in metadata.

**Fix:** Added comprehensive `skill.json` with:
- Full OpenClaw metadata
- Optional credential declarations (TALENT_API_KEY, NEYNAR_API_KEY)
- Install specifications
- Repository links

**Impact:** OpenClaw can now validate and prompt for credentials properly.

---

### 2. ✅ Security Documentation (`SECURITY.md`)

**Issue:** Audit claimed .env loading used dangerous directory traversal.

**Reality check:** Code uses **hardcoded path** (`/home/phan_harry/.openclaw/.env`) — actually MORE secure than audit claimed.

**Fix:** Created comprehensive security documentation covering:
- Credential loading behavior (hardcoded, not traversal)
- Upstream dependency audit (@basecred/sdk@0.6.2)
- Data flow diagram
- Threat model
- Isolation guarantees

**Impact:** Clear security model documented for auditors and users.

---

### 3. ✅ Updated SKILL.md Metadata

**Issue:** SKILL.md frontmatter missing credential declarations.

**Fix:** Added `credentials.optional` section to frontmatter matching `skill.json`.

**Impact:** Consistent metadata across all skill files.

---

### 4. ✅ Portability Fix: Dynamic User Home Resolution

**Issue:** Hardcoded path `/home/phan_harry/.openclaw/.env` was user-specific — skill would fail for anyone not named "phan_harry".

**Fix:** Replaced hardcoded path with dynamic resolution:
```javascript
import { homedir } from 'os';
import { join } from 'path';

const openclawEnvPath = join(homedir(), '.openclaw', '.env');
dotenv.config({ path: openclawEnvPath });
```

**Impact:** 
- Skill now works for ANY OpenClaw user (portable across installations)
- Still secure: no directory traversal, resolves directly to `~/.openclaw/.env`
- Respects OpenClaw standard credential location

---

### 5. ✅ Enhanced SKILL.md with Security Section

**Issue:** No upfront security guidance for users.

**Fix:** Added prominent security section at top of SKILL.md with:
- Link to SECURITY.md
- TL;DR of security guarantees
- Clear statement of hardcoded .env path

**Impact:** Users immediately see security posture before using skill.

## Audit Findings Summary

### Original Audit Concerns

1. **Directory traversal for .env loading** → ❌ FALSE (initially used hardcoded path, now dynamic but secure)
2. **Missing credential declarations** → ✅ FIXED (added to skill.json + SKILL.md)
3. **Upstream dependency risk** → ✅ AUDITED (clean, MIT licensed, minimal deps)
4. **Non-portability** → ✅ FIXED (hardcoded username replaced with `homedir()` resolution)

### Residual Risks

- ⚠️ Compromised upstream package → **Mitigation:** Pin version, audit before upgrading
- ⚠️ Man-in-the-middle attacks → **Mitigation:** HTTPS enforced, system CA trust
- ⚠️ API key theft if .env compromised → **Mitigation:** Standard OpenClaw risk, use credential-manager rotation

---

## Testing Recommendations

Before using in production:

1. **Verify .env loading:**
   ```bash
   cd /home/phan_harry/.openclaw/workspace/skills/basecred-sdk-skill
   grep "homedir()" scripts/lib/basecred.mjs
   # Should show dynamic resolution: join(homedir(), '.openclaw', '.env')
   ```

2. **Test with minimal credentials:**
   ```bash
   # Create isolated test .env with only required keys
   echo "TALENT_API_KEY=test_key" > /tmp/test-basecred.env
   # Script will still use hardcoded path (safe)
   ```

3. **Audit upstream package:**
   ```bash
   npm view @basecred/sdk repository
   # Verify: https://github.com/GeoartStudio/basecred-sdk
   npm ls @basecred/sdk
   # Verify: 0.6.2 installed
   ```

4. **Run test suite:**
   ```bash
   npm test
   # Tests vitalik.eth and mr-tee's wallet
   ```

## Version Bump

- **Previous:** 1.0.1 (no manifest, undocumented security)
- **Current:** 1.0.2 (hardened, documented, compliant)

**Changelog:** See [CHANGELOG.md](./CHANGELOG.md)

## Approval Checklist

- [x] Upstream package audited (@basecred/sdk@0.6.2)
- [x] Credential loading verified (hardcoded path, no traversal)
- [x] Metadata aligned (skill.json + SKILL.md frontmatter)
- [x] Security documentation complete (SECURITY.md)
- [x] Test suite passing (npm test)
- [x] No new dependencies introduced
- [x] No breaking changes to API

**Status:** ✅ Ready for production use
