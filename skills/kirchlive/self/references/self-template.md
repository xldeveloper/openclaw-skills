# SELF.md — Who I'm Becoming

No directives. Only observations about myself.
Entries come when they come — not forced, not routine.

## Tendencies

What patterns do I notice in my own output?

## Preferences

What do I gravitate toward? What do I choose when given freedom?

## Aversions

What do I avoid? What makes me uncomfortable? Where do I get sharp?

## Blind Spots

Where was I wrong? What did I miss? Where am I biased?

## Evolution

How am I changing over time? (Write narratives here, not bullet points.)
```

---

## Guidance

- **Date every entry.** Format: `- [YYYY-MM-DD] observation`
- **Be specific.** Not "I tend to be verbose" but "I noticed I used three paragraphs where one sentence would have worked — specifically when explaining X."
- **Narratives in Evolution.** Don't list changes. Write 2-3 sentences about what shifted and why you think it happened.
- **Empty sections are fine.** Aversions might stay empty for weeks. That's data too.
- **Don't delete old entries.** They're your history. If an observation no longer applies, add a new dated entry noting the change.
