## 🤖 Clawdbot Integration

### Automatic Cron Setup

The easiest way to set up match-day alerts is with the setup script:

```bash
# Run the setup script with your Telegram ID and timezone
python3 scripts/setup_crons.py <telegram_id> <timezone>

# Example
python3 scripts/setup_crons.py 123456789 "Europe/London"
python3 scripts/setup_crons.py 123456789 "America/New_York"

# Just view the cron configs without creating
python3 scripts/setup_crons.py --list
```

This creates 3 cron jobs:

| Cron Job | Schedule | Purpose |
|----------|----------|---------|
| `football-match-check` | Daily 9 AM | Checks if your teams play today |
| `spurs-live-ticker` | Every 2 mins (disabled) | Live updates during matches |
| `spurs-reminder` | Dynamic (disabled) | 30-min pre-match reminder |

### How Auto-Scheduling Works

1. **Morning check** — `football-match-check` runs at 9 AM daily
2. **Match found?** — If any team plays today, it:
   - Updates `spurs-live-ticker` to start 5 mins before kickoff
   - Sets `spurs-reminder` for 30 mins before kickoff
   - Enables both crons
3. **During match** — `spurs-live-ticker` runs every 2 mins, sending goals/cards/events
4. **No match?** — Both crons stay disabled (no spam!)

### Manual Cron Setup

If you prefer manual setup, here are the cron expressions:

```bash
# Daily match check at 9 AM
0 9 * * *    # football-match-check

# Live ticker every 2 minutes (enable only during matches)
*/2 * * * *  # spurs-live-ticker

# Pre-match reminder (set to 30 mins before kickoff)
30 14 * * *  # spurs-reminder (example: 2:30 PM for 3 PM kickoff)
```

### Cron Payload Examples

**Match Check (daily):**
```json
{
  "message": "Check if any configured teams play today. If a match is found, update spurs-live-ticker to start 5 mins before kickoff and run for 3 hours. Enable spurs-reminder for 30 mins before kickoff."
}
```

**Live Ticker (during matches):**
```json
{
  "message": "Run python3 scripts/live_monitor.py and send any new events (goals, cards, halftime, fulltime). Only message if there are updates."
}
```

### Live Monitor Script

During matches, run every 2 minutes:
```bash
python3 scripts/live_monitor.py
```

The script only outputs when there are new events (goals, cards, etc.), making it perfect for cron-based alerting.

## 🔧 Scripts Reference
