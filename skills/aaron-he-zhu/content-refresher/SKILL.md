- Industry changes require content updates
- Adding new sections to existing content
- Converting old content for GEO optimization

## What This Skill Does

1. **Freshness Analysis**: Identifies outdated content needing updates
2. **Performance Tracking**: Finds content with declining traffic
3. **Gap Identification**: Spots missing information competitors have
4. **Update Prioritization**: Ranks content by refresh potential
5. **Refresh Recommendations**: Provides specific update guidance
6. **GEO Enhancement**: Updates content for AI citation potential

## How to Use

### Identify Content to Refresh

```

```

```
Which of my blog posts have lost the most traffic?
```

### Refresh Specific Content

```
Refresh this article for [current year]: [URL/content]
```

```
Update this content to outrank [competitor URL]: [your URL]

## Data Sources

> See [CONNECTORS.md](../../CONNECTORS.md) for tool category placeholders.

**With ~~analytics + ~~search console + ~~SEO tool connected:**
Claude can automatically pull historical traffic trends from ~~analytics, fetch impression and ranking data from ~~search console, retrieve keyword position history from ~~SEO tool, and identify content with declining performance. This enables data-driven refresh prioritization.

**With manual data only:**
Ask the user to provide:
1. Traffic data or screenshots showing performance trends
2. Ranking screenshots or history for key pages
3. Content publish dates and last update dates
4. List of pages the user suspects need refreshing

Proceed with the analysis using provided data. Note in the output which findings are from automated data vs. manual review.

## Instructions

When a user requests content refresh help:

1. **CORE-EEAT Quick Score — Identify Weak Dimensions**

   Before refreshing, run a quick CORE-EEAT assessment to focus effort on the weakest areas. Reference: [CORE-EEAT Benchmark](../../references/core-eeat-benchmark.md)

   ```markdown
   ### CORE-EEAT Quick Assessment

   **Content**: [title or URL]
   **Content Type**: [type]

   Rapidly score each dimension (estimate 0-100):

   | Dimension | Quick Score | Key Weakness | Refresh Priority |
   |-----------|-----------|--------------|-----------------|
   | C — Contextual Clarity | [X]/100 | [main issue] | 🔴/🟡/🟢 |
   | O — Organization | [X]/100 | [main issue] | 🔴/🟡/🟢 |
   | R — Referenceability | [X]/100 | [main issue] | 🔴/🟡/🟢 |
   | E — Exclusivity | [X]/100 | [main issue] | 🔴/🟡/🟢 |
   | Exp — Experience | [X]/100 | [main issue] | 🔴/🟡/🟢 |
   | Ept — Expertise | [X]/100 | [main issue] | 🔴/🟡/🟢 |
   | A — Authority | [X]/100 | [main issue] | 🔴/🟡/🟢 |
   | T — Trust | [X]/100 | [main issue] | 🔴/🟡/🟢 |

   **Weakest Dimensions** (focus refresh here):
   1. [Dimension] — [what needs fixing]
   2. [Dimension] — [what needs fixing]

   **Refresh Strategy**: Focus on 🔴 dimensions first, then 🟡.
