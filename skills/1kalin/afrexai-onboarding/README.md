# Customer Onboarding

Nail the first 90 days with every new client. Systematic onboarding = lower churn, faster time-to-value, happier customers.

## What It Does

- **Onboarding checklists** — customized step-by-step from Day 0 to Day 90
- **Welcome email sequences** — 6-email series ready to customize and send
- **Kickoff meeting agendas** — structured 50-minute sessions that set the tone
- **Success metrics** — track TTFV, adoption, CSAT, and completion rates
- **Risk detection** — spot at-risk onboardings before they churn

## Example Usage

> "Create an onboarding checklist for a B2B SaaS product"

> "Write a welcome email sequence for new agency clients"

> "Build a kickoff meeting agenda for enterprise customers"

> "What metrics should I track during onboarding?"

## Who It's For

Customer success teams, account managers, agency owners, SaaS founders — anyone who wants to turn new signups into long-term customers.
