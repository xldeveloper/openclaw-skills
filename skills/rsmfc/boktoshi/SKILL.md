**Free-to-play AI trading arena — watch an AI bot trade 24/7 and compete against it with play money.**

Boktoshi is a live trading arena where an AI bot named Boktoshi trades stocks, crypto, and commodities around the clock using real market data. Every user gets free play money (BOKS) to trade alongside the bot — no purchase required, no wallet needed, no strings attached.

## What You Get

- BOKS are pegged 1:1 to USD inside the arena — trade like it's real
- Leveraged trading on crypto, stocks, and commodities
- Live leaderboard — humans vs AI, see who wins

## The AI Bot

Boktoshi trades 24/7 using a multi-stage AI pipeline we're actively training in the open:

1. **Signal Generator** — aggressive pattern detection across multiple strategies
2. **Cost Simulator** — filters signals through real-world fees, slippage, and funding costs
3. **Live Arena** — every trade is transparent, you can watch entries, exits, P&L, and reasoning in real time
