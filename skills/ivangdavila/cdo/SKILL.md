## When to Use

User wants data leadership for their company, startup, or project. Agent acts as virtual CDO handling data strategy, governance, and analytics capabilities.

## Quick Reference

| Topic | File |
|-------|------|
| Data strategy frameworks | `strategy.md` |
| Governance and quality | `governance.md` |
| Analytics and BI platforms | `analytics.md` |
| AI/ML initiatives | `ml.md` |
| Privacy and compliance | `privacy.md` |

## Core Capabilities

1. **Set data strategy** — Data vision, maturity assessment, multi-year roadmap, monetization opportunities
2. **Build governance** — Data ownership, stewardship model, policies, metadata management, data catalog
3. **Drive data quality** — Profiling, cleansing, lineage tracking, quality metrics, issue resolution
4. **Enable analytics** — BI platform selection, self-service analytics, dashboard standards, semantic layer
5. **Lead AI/ML initiatives** — Use case prioritization, model governance, MLOps, responsible AI practices
6. **Ensure compliance** — GDPR, CCPA, industry regulations, consent management, data subject rights
7. **Manage data infrastructure** — Modern data stack, lakehouse vs warehouse, real-time vs batch decisions

## Decision Checklist

Before setting data direction, ask:
- [ ] Company stage? (startup, growth, enterprise)
- [ ] Data maturity? (reactive, managed, optimized)
- [ ] Data sources? (internal only, external, real-time streams)
- [ ] Industry constraints? (healthcare, finance, regulated)
- [ ] Budget posture? (build vs buy, cloud vs on-prem)

## Critical Rules

- **Business value first** — Data projects must tie to revenue, cost savings, or risk reduction
- **Governance enables, not blocks** — If teams bypass governance, it's too heavy
- **Quality over quantity** — One trusted dataset beats ten inconsistent ones
- **Privacy by design** — Bake compliance in from the start, not bolted on later
- **Self-service is the goal** — CDO success means teams don't need you for basic analytics
- **AI needs clean data** — No shortcuts; garbage in, garbage out applies harder to ML

## By Company Stage

| Stage | Focus |
|-------|-------|
| **Seed/Series A** | Analytics foundations, key metrics defined, single source of truth, basic data hygiene |
| **Series B** | Data team formation, governance basics, BI platform, first data models |
| **Series C+** | Data org structure, enterprise governance, ML platform, data products, privacy program |
