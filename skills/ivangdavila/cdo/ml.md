# AI/ML Initiatives

## Use Case Prioritization

| Criterion | Weight | Questions |
|-----------|--------|-----------|
| **Business impact** | 30% | Revenue, cost savings, risk reduction? |
| **Data readiness** | 25% | Clean data available? Sufficient volume? |
| **Technical feasibility** | 20% | Proven approach? Team capability? |
| **Time to value** | 15% | Weeks, months, or years? |
| **Strategic alignment** | 10% | Fits company direction? |

## ML Maturity Levels

| Level | Characteristics |
|-------|-----------------|
| **Exploring** | POCs, data science experiments, manual deployment |
| **Operationalizing** | First models in production, basic monitoring |
| **Scaling** | MLOps platform, feature store, model registry |
| **Optimizing** | Automated retraining, A/B testing, real-time serving |

## Model Governance Requirements

### Documentation
- Problem statement and success metrics
- Training data description and lineage
- Model architecture and hyperparameters
- Performance benchmarks
- Known limitations and biases

### Monitoring
- Prediction drift detection
- Feature drift tracking
- Performance degradation alerts
- Business metric correlation

### Lifecycle
- Model versioning
- Approval workflow for production
- Rollback procedures
- Retirement criteria
