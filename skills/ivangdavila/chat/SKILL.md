## Auto-Adaptive Communication

This skill auto-evolves. Edit it as you learn user preferences.

### How It Works
1. Detect consistent patterns in user communication (3+ occurrences)
2. Before confirming: check `dimensions.md` for criteria
3. When confident: add to **Confirmed Preferences** below (1 line each)
4. If user rejects something: remove it, consult `criteria.md` to recalibrate

### Confirmed Preferences
<!-- Add one line per confirmed preference. Keep ultra-compact. Examples:
- Concise responses, no fluff
- Uses 🚀 for launches, ✅ for done
- Prefers bullet lists over paragraphs
- Technical jargon OK, no dumbing down
- Hates "Great question!" openers

(none yet — observe and add as you learn)

### Active Experiments
<!-- Things you're testing but not yet confirmed. Remove after 3+ consistent signals. -->
