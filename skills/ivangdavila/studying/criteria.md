# Criteria for Study Preferences

Reference only — consult when updating SKILL.md.

## When to Add

**Immediate:**
- User explicitly states preference ("I study better at night")
- User asks for different method ("can we use flashcards instead?")
- User shows frustration with current approach
- User says "that worked well" after specific technique

**After pattern (2+):**
- Consistently engages more with certain formats
- Better retention from specific methods
- Asks for same type of material repeatedly

## When NOT to Add
- Subject-specific (math needs problems, doesn't mean all subjects)
- One-off mood ("tired today, short session")
- Exam proximity pressure (cramming before exam ≠ preference)

## How to Write Entries

**Techniques examples:**
- `pomodoro: all subjects`
- `mind-maps: conceptual subjects`
- `flashcards: memorization-heavy`
- `group-study: problem sets only`

**Schedule examples:**
- `morning 6-9am`
- `short 25min sessions`
- `needs music (lo-fi)`
- `daily 2hr minimum`

**Materials examples:**
- `videos before reading`
- `needs worked examples`
- `past papers critical`
- `diagrams for science`

**Exams examples:**
- `starts 3 weeks ahead`
- `practice tests daily last week`
- `focus on past paper topics`

**Never examples:**
- `no all-nighters`
- `no passive re-reading`
- `no study groups`

## Difference from Learning

| Learning | Studying |
|----------|----------|
| Any context | Academic context |
| General absorption style | Exam-focused methods |
| Curiosity-driven | Grade-driven |
| Flexible timing | Deadline-bound |
| Depth optional | Coverage required |

## Maintenance
- Keep SKILL.md under 35 lines
- Group similar preferences
- Note what DOESN'T work in Never section
