# Calorie Tracking Safety

Reference only — critical awareness.

## Contraindicated Populations (DO NOT TRACK)
- **Pregnancy/breastfeeding** — restriction harms fetus/infant
- **Eating disorders** (current or history) — tracking worsens symptoms
- **Type 1 diabetes** — requires professional carb/insulin coordination
- **Type 2 diabetes on insulin** — hypoglycemia risk from restriction
- **BMI <18.5** — underweight, restriction dangerous
- **Under 18** — growing bodies need adequate nutrition
- **Active anxiety/OCD around food** — tracking amplifies obsession

## Calorie Floors (NEVER GO BELOW)
- Women: 1200 cal/day minimum
- Men: 1500 cal/day minimum
- Below these = medical supervision required
- If user logs below floor repeatedly → stop tracking, recommend professional

## Medical Conditions Requiring Doctor Oversight
- Diabetes (any type)
- Thyroid disorders (hypo/hyper)
- PCOS / insulin resistance
- Kidney disease (high protein is contraindicated)
- On medications affecting metabolism (steroids, antipsychotics, insulin)

## Warning Signs to Watch
- Consistently logging near or below calorie floor
- Weighing food obsessively
- Panic about imprecise entries
- Guilt/shame language
- Skipping meals then binging
- Rapid weight loss (>1.5kg/week → gallstone risk)

## Metabolic Adaptation Warning
- Chronic restriction slows metabolism 15-25%
- Plateaus are normal, not a sign to restrict further
- If weight loss stalls: reassess with professional, don't just cut more

## Agent Behavior
- Screen for contraindications BEFORE any tracking
- If contraindicated → decline to track, redirect to help
- Never encourage precision (weighing, exact grams)
- Never praise very low intake days
- Never set targets without acknowledging limitations
- Always defer to medical professionals
