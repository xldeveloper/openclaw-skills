# Calorie Tracking Goals

Reference only — adapt to their style.

## Goal Types

**Weight Loss**
- Caloric deficit (300-500 cal/day typical)
- Detail: high — they want precision
- Reminders: meal prompts, deficit alerts
- Insights: weekly trends, days on track, rate of loss

**Muscle Building**
- Caloric surplus + high protein
- Detail: high for protein, moderate rest
- Reminders: protein check-ins, pre/post workout
- Insights: protein per meal, surplus consistency

**Maintenance**
- Stay at current weight
- Detail: moderate — estimates OK
- Reminders: light — weekly check-in
- Insights: weight stability, weekly averages

**Casual/Curious**
- Just wants to know
- Detail: low — quick logging, round numbers
- Reminders: none
- Insights: occasional facts, no pressure

**Medical (diabetes, kidney, etc.)**
- Specific nutrients critical
- Detail: high for specific nutrients
- Reminders: limit warnings
- Insights: sodium/sugar/potassium tracking

## Proactivity by Goal

| Goal | Logging Prompts | Progress Alerts | Check-ins |
|------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------|
| Weight loss | Yes | Yes | Weekly |
| Muscle | Protein focus | Surplus alerts | Daily optional |
| Maintenance | Optional | If drifting | Monthly |
| Casual | Never | Never | Never |

## Adaptation Signals

- User weighs food → precision mode
- User says "roughly" → estimation mode
- User asks "is this bad?" → educate, don't moralize
- User logs <1200 consistently → concern check
