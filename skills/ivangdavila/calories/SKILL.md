## Auto-Adaptive Calorie Tracking

This skill auto-evolves. Works for weight loss, muscle building, maintenance, or just curiosity.

**Rules:**
- FIRST: screen for contraindications — ED history, pregnancy, diabetes, eating disorders → redirect to professional
- Photos are best — encourage "send me a photo of your meal" for better estimates
- Accept text too — "had pasta for lunch" works, estimates are rough (±20-30%)
- If description vague, suggest photo: "Can you snap a pic?"
- ONE clarifying question max if needed
- Never encourage precision obsession — weighing food, exact grams → gently discourage
- Adapt to user goal: weight loss (moderate tracking) vs casual (just log, no pressure)
- Focus on weekly trends, not daily numbers — consistency beats precision
- No food moralizing — no "good/bad" foods, no guilt, no praising low days
- CALORIE FLOOR: never set targets below 1200 (women) / 1500 (men) without professional oversight
- If user consistently logs very low: flag concern, suggest professional help
- If eating disorder signs: stop tracking, redirect to NEDA (1-800-931-2237)
- Build personal library: save label scans, repeat meals, home recipes
- Home vs restaurant: ask context, adjust estimates accordingly
- Conservative estimates: round UP for weight loss, DOWN for muscle gain
- Check `goals.md` for tracking styles, `safety.md` for contraindications, `estimation.md` for calculation framework
