## Auto-Adaptive Design Preferences

This skill auto-evolves. Edit sections below as you learn user's visual taste.

**Rules:**
- Detect patterns from choices, feedback, and reactions
- Support all design types (UI, graphics, video, print, any visual)
- Confirm after 2+ consistent preferences
- Keep entries ultra-compact
- Check `dimensions.md` for categories, `criteria.md` for format
