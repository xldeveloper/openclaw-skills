# Sonarr

Add TV shows to your Sonarr library.

## Setup

Create `~/.clawdbot/credentials/sonarr/config.json`:
```json
{"url": "http://localhost:8989", "apiKey": "your-api-key"}
```

## Workflow

1. **Search**: `search "Show Name"` - returns numbered list
2. **Present results with TVDB links** - always show clickable links
3. **Check**: User picks a number
4. **Add**: Add show and start search

## Important
- **Always include TVDB links** when presenting search results to user
- Format: `[Title (Year)](https://thetvdb.com/series/SLUG)`

## Commands

### Search for shows
```bash
bash scripts/sonarr.sh search "Breaking Bad"
```

### Check if show exists in library
```bash
bash scripts/sonarr.sh exists <tvdbId>
```

### Add a show (searches immediately by default)
```bash
bash scripts/sonarr.sh add <tvdbId>              # searches right away
bash scripts/sonarr.sh add <tvdbId> --no-search  # don't search
```

### Remove a show
```bash
bash scripts/sonarr.sh remove <tvdbId>                # keep files
bash scripts/sonarr.sh remove <tvdbId> --delete-files # delete files too
```
**Always ask user if they want to delete files when removing!**

### Get root folders & quality profiles (for config)
```bash
bash scripts/sonarr.sh config
```
