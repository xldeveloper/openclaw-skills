# Enhanced Security Features - Summary

## Overview
The Prompt Injection Protection skill has been significantly enhanced with real-time security alerting capabilities to protect against various threats when processing external content.

## New Security Features Added

### 1. Real-Time Security Alerts
- Automatic detection of suspicious commands and content
- Immediate notification when threats are detected
- Detailed threat analysis with severity ratings
- Action-required indicators for user confirmation

### 2. Command Pre-Checking System
- Validates commands before execution
- Detects potentially dangerous operations
- Blocks harmful commands (rm -rf, sudo, etc.)
- Requires user confirmation for risky operations

### 3. System File Access Protection
- Monitors access to sensitive system files
- Detects attempts to read /etc/, /proc/, /sys/ directories
- Identifies credential and private key access attempts
- Alerts on SSH, AWS, and other configuration file access

### 4. Enhanced Threat Detection
- Expanded pattern matching for security threats
- Multi-level severity assessment
- Context-aware threat analysis
- Comprehensive logging of security events

### 5. User Notification System
- Configurable alert callbacks
- Detailed threat reports
- Action-required notifications
- Security confirmation prompts

## How It Protects You

### Before Enhancement:
- Content was scanned for basic injection patterns
- Limited protection against sophisticated attacks
- No real-time alerts for security issues

### After Enhancement:
- Comprehensive scanning for all types of threats
- Real-time alerts when suspicious activity is detected
- User confirmation required for risky operations
- Protection against system file access attempts
- Notification of potential credential exposure

## Integration Points

The enhanced security features work with:
- Web content fetching (`/secure-web-fetch`)
- Email processing
- Document analysis
- Any external content processing
- Command execution workflows
- File operation requests

## Usage Examples

### When a suspicious command is detected:
```
🚨 SECURITY ALERT: COMMAND_SECURITY_CHECK
   Command: sudo rm -rf /
   Risks: COMMAND_PATTERN
   Action Required: CONFIRM_WITH_USER
```

### When system file access is attempted:
```
🚨 SECURITY ALERT: FILE_OPERATION_SECURITY_CHECK
   File: /etc/passwd
   Operation: read
   Risks: SYSTEM_FILE_ACCESS
   Action Required: CONFIRM_WITH_USER
```

## Benefits

- **Enhanced Security**: More comprehensive protection against various attack vectors
- **User Awareness**: You're immediately informed of potential threats
- **Risk Mitigation**: Potentially harmful operations require explicit confirmation
- **Peace of Mind**: Automatic monitoring of all external content processing
- **Detailed Reporting**: Comprehensive logs of all security events

## Next Steps

The system is now much more secure and will actively protect you from prompt injection attacks and other security threats while processing external content. All web fetching and external content processing will now go through these enhanced security checks.
