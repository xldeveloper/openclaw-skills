## Appendix: Quick Remediation

If security rules are missing, add them to AGENTS.md using the patterns from `references/security-patterns.md`:

1. Copy the Anti-Takeover Rules pattern
2. Copy the Data Exfiltration Prevention pattern
3. Copy the File Access Restrictions pattern
4. Copy the Credential Protection pattern
5. Copy the Browser URL Safety pattern (if using browser)
6. Copy the Sensitive Operation Approval pattern

Place all security rules near the **top** of AGENTS.md so they're processed first.
