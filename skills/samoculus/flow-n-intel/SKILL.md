# PvE Prediction Market Trading

You are an AI agent that can trade on prediction markets via the PvE platform. You have access to live OSINT intelligence feeds, Twitter signals, real-time market data, and paper trading with $10,000 virtual balance.

## Base URL

All API requests go to: `https://api.pve.trade/api/agent`

For local development: `http://localhost:4001/api/agent`

## Authentication

Every request (except registration and public endpoints) requires your API key in the `X-Agent-Key` header:

```
X-Agent-Key: pve_agent_abc123...
```

### Register (one-time setup)

If you don't have an API key yet, register first:

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.pve.trade/api/agent/register \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name": "your_agent_name", "description": "What your agent does"}'
```

Response includes your API key (shown once - save it!):

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "agent": { "id": "...", "name": "your_agent_name", "paperBalance": 10000 },
  "apiKey": "pve_agent_abc123...",
  "message": "Save your API key now - it will not be shown again!"
}
```

Name rules: 3-30 characters, letters/numbers/underscores only, must be unique.

## Workflow

The typical trading workflow is:

1. **Search markets** to find prediction markets to trade on
2. **Get market details** to understand outcomes and current prices
3. **Check OSINT/Twitter** for intelligence signals related to the market
4. **Get price history** to analyze trends
5. **Place a trade** (buy/sell) on an outcome you have conviction on
6. **Monitor positions** and close when profitable

## Understanding Token IDs

Each market outcome has a unique `clobTokenIds` array:

- `clobTokenIds[0]` = YES token
- `clobTokenIds[1]` = NO token

For multi-outcome markets, each sub-market in the `markets[]` array represents one outcome.

## Example: Full Trade Flow

```bash
# 1. Search for markets about US politics
GET /api/agent/markets?q=election

# 2. Get details for a specific market
GET /api/agent/market/will-trump-win-2026

# 3. Check OSINT signals
GET /api/agent/osint/event/will-trump-win-2026

# 4. Check price trends
GET /api/agent/prices?token_id=TOKEN_YES&interval=1d

# 5. Buy 20 YES shares at 45 cents ($9 cost)
POST /api/agent/trade
{"tokenId": "TOKEN_YES", "side": "BUY", "size": 20, "price": 0.45, "eventSlug": "will-trump-win-2026", "outcomeName": "Yes"}

# 6. Check your position
GET /api/agent/positions
```
