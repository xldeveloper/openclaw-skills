# Game Cog - Build Game Worlds, Not Just Sprites

**Other tools generate sprites. CellCog builds game worlds.** #1 on DeepResearch Bench (Feb 2026) for deep game design reasoning.

Game development is a multi-discipline problem — mechanics, art, music, UI, and level design all need to feel unified. CellCog reasons deeply about your game's vision first, then produces character-consistent art, tilesets, music, sound effects, UI elements, 3D models, and full game design documents — all cohesive from a single brief.

## Prerequisites

This skill requires the CellCog mothership skill for SDK setup and API calls.

```bash
clawhub install cellcog
```

**Read the cellcog skill first** for SDK setup. This skill shows you what's possible.

**Quick pattern (v1.0+):**
```python
# Fire-and-forget - returns immediately
result = client.create_chat(
    prompt="[your game dev request]",
    notify_session_key="agent:main:main",
    task_label="game-dev",
    chat_mode="agent"  # Agent mode for most game assets
)
# Daemon notifies you when complete - do NOT poll
```

## What You Can Create

### Character Design

Bring your game characters to life:

## Art Styles

| Style | Best For | Characteristics |
|-------|----------|-----------------|

| **Hand-Painted** | RPGs, fantasy | Rich, detailed, artistic |
| **Vector/Flat** | Mobile, casual | Clean, scalable, modern |

## Chat Mode for Game Dev

| Scenario | Recommended Mode |
|----------|------------------|
| Individual assets, sprites, character designs, UI elements | `"agent"` |
| Full game concepts, complex world building, narrative design | `"agent team"` |

**Use `"agent"` for most game assets.** Characters, tilesets, UI elements execute well in agent mode.

**Use `"agent team"` for game design depth** - full GDDs, complex narratives, or when you need multiple creative angles explored.

## Tips for Better Game Assets

1. **Specify dimensions**: "32x32 tiles" or "1920x1080 background" prevents mismatched assets.

2. **Reference existing games**: "Style like Hollow Knight" or "Celeste-inspired" gives clear direction.

3. **Think about implementation**: Request assets in formats your engine can use. Mention if you need transparency, layers, or specific file types.

4. **Consistency matters**: When requesting multiple assets, describe your game's overall style guide so everything matches.

5. **Animation frames**: Specify frame count and whether you need sprite sheets or individual frames.

6. **Consider your scope**: Start with placeholder assets and iterate. Perfect is the enemy of shipped.
