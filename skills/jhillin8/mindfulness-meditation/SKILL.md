# Mindfulness & Meditation

Build a consistent meditation practice with guided sessions, progress tracking, and daily mindfulness reminders.

## What it does

This skill transforms your device into a personal meditation coach. It guides you through structured meditation sessions, tracks your practice streaks, logs sessions for long-term insights, and sends mindfulness reminders to keep you anchored throughout your day.

## Usage

### Start Meditation
Initiate a guided meditation session. Choose your meditation type and duration, then follow along with step-by-step guidance.

### Quick Mindfulness
Take a 2-5 minute breathing pause. Perfect for stressful moments or transitions between tasks. No commitment, just presence.

### Check Streak
View your current meditation streak and session history. See weekly/monthly breakdowns of your practice consistency and total minutes logged.

### Set Reminders
Configure daily or custom mindfulness reminders. Get gentle notifications to pause, breathe, and check in with yourself.

### Session Log
Review detailed logs of past sessions: type, duration, date, and personal notes. Export your practice data for reflection or sharing.

## Meditation Types

**Body Scan** — Systematically observe sensations from head to toe, releasing tension and building bodily awareness.

**Breath Focus** — Anchor attention to the natural rhythm of your breath. Redirect your mind gently when it wanders.

**Loving-Kindness** — Cultivate compassion by sending well-wishes to yourself and others in expanding circles.

**Walking** — Meditate while moving. Synchronize breath with steps and notice your surroundings with full attention.

**Open Awareness** — Observe thoughts and sensations without judgment. Develop witness consciousness and mental spaciousness.

## Session Lengths

- **2 min** — Micro-practice. Reset focus in the middle of your day.
- **5 min** — Short sits. Build the habit without time friction.
- **10 min** — Standard practice. Enough depth to settle your mind.
- **20 min** — Deep work. Move beyond the surface chatter.
- **Custom** — Set your own duration. Practice at your pace.

## Tips

- **Start small:** 2-3 minutes daily beats sporadic hour-long sessions. Consistency compounds over time.
- **Pick one type:** Master breath focus before exploring other techniques. Foundation first.
- **Meditate at the same time:** Morning sits anchor your day. Neural pathways strengthen with repetition.
- **Don't aim for blank mind:** Thoughts are normal. The skill is noticing them without judgment—that's the practice.
- **All data stays local on your machine:** Your meditation history, preferences, and reminders are stored securely on your device. Nothing leaves your control.
