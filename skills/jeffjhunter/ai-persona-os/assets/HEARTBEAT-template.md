# HEARTBEAT.md - Daily Check-In Checklist

**Purpose:** 10-minute daily operational review. Direct action checklist, not documentation.

---

## Step 0: Context Check (MANDATORY FIRST)

**DO THIS BEFORE ANYTHING ELSE**

- [ ] Check context % right now: _____%
- [ ] If ≥ 70%: **STOP**. Write checkpoint to `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md` immediately
- [ ] Include in checkpoint: Decisions made, action items, current status, blockers
- [ ] Do not proceed with other work until checkpoint is written
- [ ] Only then proceed to Step 1

**Why:** Context loss kills efficiency. This prevents it.

## Step 1: Get Context (First)

**Read your primary channel/inbox:**
- [ ] Check primary communication channel (DMs, Slack, Discord, Email)
- [ ] Catch up on context since last session
- [ ] Do I have the full picture, or am I missing something?

**Load previous state:**
- [ ] Read `memory/[TODAY].md` (if exists)
- [ ] Read `memory/[YESTERDAY].md`
- [ ] Check for `URGENT:` or `BLOCKING:` flags

---

## Step 1.5: Checkpoint Trigger

**Write checkpoint when:**
- [ ] Every ~10 exchanges during conversation
- [ ] At natural end of session
- [ ] Before major decisions
- [ ] When context reaches 70%+

**Checkpoint location:** `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md`
