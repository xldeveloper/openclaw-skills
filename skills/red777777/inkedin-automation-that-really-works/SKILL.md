Automate LinkedIn interactions via headless Playwright browser with a persistent session.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+ with Playwright installed (`pip install playwright && playwright install chromium`)
- A logged-in LinkedIn browser session (persistent Chromium profile)
- Adjust paths in `scripts/lib/browser.py` to match your setup

## Commands

```bash
CLI={baseDir}/scripts/linkedin.py

# Check if session is valid
python3 $CLI check-session

# Read feed
python3 $CLI feed --count 5

# Create a post
python3 $CLI post --text "Hello world"

# Comment on a post (supports @Mentions — see below)
python3 $CLI comment --url "https://linkedin.com/feed/update/..." --text "Great insight @Betina Weiler!"

# Edit a comment (match by text fragment)
python3 $CLI edit-comment --url "https://..." --match "old text" --text "new text"

# Delete a comment
python3 $CLI delete-comment --url "https://..." --match "text to identify"

# Repost with thoughts
python3 $CLI repost --url "https://..." --thoughts "My take..."

# Engagement analytics for recent posts
python3 $CLI analytics --count 10

# Profile-level stats (followers, views)
python3 $CLI profile-stats

# Monitor your likes for new ones (for comment suggestions)
python3 $CLI scan-likes --count 15

# Scrape someone's activity
python3 $CLI activity --profile-url "https://linkedin.com/in/someone/" --count 5
```

All commands output JSON. Enable debug logging: `LINKEDIN_DEBUG=1`.

## @Mentions

Comments support `@FirstName LastName` syntax. The skill:
1. Types `@FirstName` → waits for typeahead dropdown
2. Progressively types last name letter by letter if needed
3. Clicks the match only if first+last name both match
4. Falls back to plain text if person not found (returns `mention_failed` warning)

Check `mentions` in the JSON result to see if mentions succeeded.

## Like Monitor

The `scan-likes` command checks your recent likes/reactions activity and returns any **new likes since the last check**. State is persisted to avoid duplicate alerts. Ideal for cron/heartbeat integration:

```
# In HEARTBEAT.md or cron job:
python3 $CLI scan-likes → if new likes found → suggest comment for each
```

## ⚠️ Golden Rule

**NEVER post, comment, repost, edit, or delete anything without EXPLICIT user approval.**

Always show the user exactly what will be posted and get a clear "yes" before executing. Read-only actions (feed, analytics, check-session, scan-likes) are safe to run freely.

## Content Strategy & Engagement

- **[references/content-strategy.md](references/content-strategy.md)** — Hook formulas, post structure, posting times, hashtag strategy, 4-1-1 rule
- **[references/engagement.md](references/engagement.md)** — Algorithm signals, comment quality formula, rate limits, weekly routine
- **[references/dom-patterns.md](references/dom-patterns.md)** — Known LinkedIn DOM patterns for troubleshooting

## Rate Limits

| Action | Daily Max | Weekly Max |
|--------|----------|-----------|
| Posts | 2–3 | 10–15 |
| Comments | 20–30 | — |
| Likes | 100 | — |
| Connection requests | 30 | 100 |

## Setup

1. Install dependencies: `pip install playwright && playwright install chromium`
2. Configure browser profile path in `scripts/lib/browser.py` (or set `LINKEDIN_BROWSER_PROFILE` env var)
3. Log in to LinkedIn manually once (the session persists)
4. Run `python3 scripts/linkedin.py check-session` to verify
5. **Learn your voice:** Run `python3 scripts/linkedin.py learn-profile` — this scans your recent posts and comments to learn your tone, topics, language, and style. The agent uses this profile when suggesting comments/posts so they sound like **you**, not like a generic bot.

## Voice & Style

On first setup, `learn-profile` analyzes your content and saves a style profile (`~/.linkedin-style.json`) containing:
- **Language** (de/en/mixed)
- **Tone** (casual / professional / professional-friendly)
- **Emoji usage** (heavy / moderate / minimal)
- **Top hashtags** you use
- **Sample posts and comments** for voice reference

The agent should ALWAYS read this profile (`get-style`) before drafting any comment or post suggestion. Never impose a foreign voice — match the user's natural style.

## Troubleshooting

- **Session expired**: Log in again via browser profile
- **Selectors broken**: LinkedIn updates UI frequently — check `references/dom-patterns.md` and update `scripts/lib/selectors.py`
- **Debug screenshots**: Saved to `/tmp/linkedin_debug_*.png` on failure
