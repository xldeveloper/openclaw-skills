# LinkedIn Engagement Guide

## Algorithm Signals (ranked by weight)

1. **Comments** — weighted ~10x more than likes
2. **Dwell time** — how long people read your post
3. **Saves** — signals high value content
4. **Early engagement** — first 60 min is critical
5. **Replies to comments** — keeps post in feeds longer
6. **Shares** — lower weight than comments

## Comment Strategy

### Quality Comment Formula

```
[Acknowledgment] + [Your perspective/experience] + [Question or extension]
```

**Examples:**

> "This resonates. In my experience, [related insight]. Have you found [question]?"

> "Interesting take. I'd push back slightly on [point] because [reason]. What do you think about [alternative]?"

> "Went through something similar. The game-changer for me was [insight]."

### Comment Timing
- **Golden hour**: Comment within 60 min of posting
- **Sweet spot targets**: Posts with 5–50 comments (not viral yet, not dead)
- **Engage up**: Comment on people 1–2 levels above you

### What NOT to comment
- "Great post!" (bot behavior)
- Generic emoji-only reactions
- Copy-paste templates
- Self-promotional plugs
