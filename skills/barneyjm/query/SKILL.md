```

### Search with AI answer
```bash
./scripts/query.sh '{"query": "best brunch spots in Brooklyn", "answer": true}'
```

### Historical data query

./scripts/query.sh '{"query": "restaurants", "lat": 40.7589, "lon": -73.9851, "time": "2020-01-01"}'
```

## Best Practices

- For known locations (cities, landmarks), you can omit lat/lon and let the AI generate coordinates
- Use `rank: true` for more relevant results when searching by attributes (e.g., "quiet", "cheap")
- Enable `answer: true` when you need a natural language summary of results
- Use `mode: "advanced"` for richer place data from web sources
- Keep queries descriptive but concise for best AI interpretation
