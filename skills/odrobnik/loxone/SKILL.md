# Loxone (Smart Home)

## Setup
- Create `config.json` next to this file (it is gitignored). Start from `config.json.example`.

## Commands
- `python3 scripts/loxone.py rooms`
- `python3 scripts/loxone.py map`
- `python3 scripts/loxone.py status "<Room>"`
- `python3 scripts/loxone.py control "<Room>" "<Control>" on|off`
- `python3 scripts/loxone_watch.py --room "<Room>" [--changes-only] [--duration <sec>]`

## Notes
- Treat as **read-only by default**; only use control commands when explicitly requested.
- WebSocket auth can be finicky; if WS fails, fall back to HTTP status queries.
