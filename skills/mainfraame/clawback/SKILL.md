# ClawBack

**Mirror congressional stock trades with automated broker execution**

## Agent Instructions

When the user invokes `/clawback`, execute the appropriate command based on the argument:

### Commands

| Command | Action |
|---------|--------|
| `/clawback setup` | Interactive setup - prompt for credentials (see below) |
| `/clawback status` | Check status: `cd {baseDir} && source venv/bin/activate && python -m clawback.cli status` |
| `/clawback run` | Start trading: `cd {baseDir} && source venv/bin/activate && python -m clawback.cli run` |
| `/clawback` | Default to status check |

### `/clawback setup` - Interactive Setup Flow

When user runs `/clawback setup`, follow these steps:

**Step 1: Install dependencies (if needed)**
Check if `{baseDir}/venv` exists. If not, run:
```bash
cd {baseDir} && python3 -m venv venv && source venv/bin/activate && pip install -e .
```

**Step 2: Prompt for E*TRADE credentials**
Ask the user for each value:

1. **Environment**: Ask "Do you want to use **sandbox** (testing) or **production** (real money)?"
   - Default: sandbox

2. **Consumer Key**: Ask "Enter your E*TRADE Consumer Key (from developer.etrade.com):"
   - Required field

3. **Consumer Secret**: Ask "Enter your E*TRADE Consumer Secret:"
   - Required field

4. **Account ID**: Ask "Enter your E*TRADE Account ID (or leave blank to get it after OAuth):"
   - Optional - can be obtained later

**Step 3: Save configuration**
Create/update `~/.clawback/config.json` with the provided values:
```json
{
  "broker": {
    "adapter": "etrade",
    "environment": "<sandbox or production>",
    "credentials": {
      "apiKey": "<consumer_key>",
      "apiSecret": "<consumer_secret>"
    }
  },
  "trading": {
    "accountId": "<account_id>",
    "initialCapital": 50000,
    "tradeScalePercentage": 0.01,
    "maxPositionPercentage": 0.05,
    "dailyLossLimit": 0.02
  },
  "notifications": {
    "telegram": {
      "enabled": true,
      "useOpenClaw": true
    }
  },
  "congress": {
    "dataSource": "official",
    "pollIntervalHours": 24,
    "minimumTradeSize": 10000
  }
}
```

**Step 4: Confirm setup**
Tell the user: "Configuration saved to ~/.clawback/config.json. Run `/clawback status` to verify."

### Getting E*TRADE API Credentials

Direct user to: https://developer.etrade.com
1. Create a developer account
2. Create a new app (sandbox first for testing)
3. Copy the Consumer Key and Consumer Secret

### Configuration Location

- Config file: `~/.clawback/config.json`
- Skill directory: `{baseDir}`

### Reading Saved Configuration

To check if the user has configured credentials, read `~/.clawback/config.json`:
- If file doesn't exist or credentials are empty → prompt for setup
- If credentials exist → can proceed with status/run commands

The CLI automatically reads from `~/.clawback/config.json` for all operations.

### Checking Setup Status

Before running `/clawback status` or `/clawback run`, verify:
1. `{baseDir}/venv` exists (dependencies installed)
2. `~/.clawback/config.json` exists with non-empty `broker.credentials.apiKey`

If either is missing, suggest running `/clawback setup` first.
